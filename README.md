RStudio project for preparing data and performing the poverty mapping analysis 
for Poland. It collects data from various sources, cleans and merges it, and 
prepares data sets for analysis. Then, poverty mapping is performed.

This project relies on the `renv` R package to ensure that the same version of 
all supporting packages is being used by the users. To control for the version 
change in the scripts, `git` is used locally with a corresponding github account. 
Any data in the data folder and subfolders are ignored, therefore, will not 
appear in the GitHub history to preserve privacy.
